Seriously needed making story scripts:
1. Nestable "Or" and "And" gates (especially handy "when used in conjunction within "conditions" section)
2. "Multiply" and "Divide" options on values
3. Ability to create functions with custom local parameters
4. Read X coordinates of characters, movetargets, items
5. Read Y coordinates of characters, movetargets, items
6. Read Z coordinates of characters, movetargets, items

Fast calculations
* Read 2D Distance between characters and characters, items and movetargets
* Read 3D Distance between characters and characters, items and movetargets
